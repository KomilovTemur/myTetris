# Welcome to My Tetris
***
My Tetris is a very fun and enjoyable game. It took me a month to work on this game and I made it.
## Task
TODO - What is the problem? And where is the challenge?
During the process of creating the game, I faced many problems. The main challenge was to produce Tetris shapes that fit the game. I wrote a lot of code and called a lot of functions.
## Description
TODO - How have you solved the problem?
I thought a lot to solve this mammon, I searched a lot, watched videos, asked my friends for help and solved this mammon
## Installation
TODO - How to install your project? npm install? make? make re?
When setting up the project, I created a lot of functions myself in Javascrip and applied them where necessary. I didn't install npm I wrote clean code and tried to use it fully.
## Usage
TODO - How does it work?
Easy to use, npm mod used and deployed to server, you play the game for fun. The game is very simple and clear



### The Core Team
